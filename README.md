# LeastCommonAncestor-relevant
Simplifying DAGs and networks to lca-relevant and LCA-relevant DAGs.

## Installation

The program requires Python 3.10 or higher.

#### Dependencies

* [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)

In the provided larger example, the following tools are required
* [PhyloX](https://github.com/RemieJanssen/PhyloX) for parsing Newick format network
* [Pydot](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/) orâ€š better yet, [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/) since Pydot is no longer maintained. However, Pygraphviz can be difficult to install properly and Pydot works rather well on the particular example we provide.
