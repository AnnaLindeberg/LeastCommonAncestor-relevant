# LeastCommonAncestor-relevant
Simplifying DAGs and networks to lca-relevant and LCA-relevant DAGs.

## Installation

The program requires Python 3.10 or higher.

#### Dependencies

* [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/)

In the provided larger example, the following tools are required
* [PhyloX](https://github.com/RemieJanssen/PhyloX) for parsing Newick format network
* [Pydot](https://pypi.org/project/pydot/) 

  Since since Pydot is no longer maintained you can, instead  also uncomment the three lines following "If you DO have pygraphviz installed and working, the following can be used" 
  and use [PyGraphviz](https://pygraphviz.github.io/). However, Pygraphviz can be difficult to install properly and Pydot still works very well.
